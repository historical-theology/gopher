This is a gopher hole that contains most of the same contents as  my professional website (coreystephan.com). You may find it at 

gopher://coreystephan.duckdns.org/

Chiefly, hosting the gopher hole is a hobby exercise. coreystephan.com remains the source of truth. Yet, I have no qualm with anyone reading the same content in my gopher hole.

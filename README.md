This is a Gopher Hole version of my professional website, coreystephan.com, which one can find at gopher://coreystephan.duckdns.org/

Chiefly, hosting the Gopher Hole is a hobby exercise. coreystephan.com remains the source of truth. Yet, I have no qualm with anyone reading the same content in my Gopher Hole.

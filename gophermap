My broad fields of study are Patristics and the theology of the Latin 
Middle Ages and Greek Byzantine periods, and my primary research area 
is the Latin Scholastic reception of the late Greek Fathers of the 
Church. For my academic statement, see stuff/academia.

Fueled by a Catholic desire to see humanity flourish with new 
technology rather than suffer from it, I advocate free and open 
source software (FOSS). I also have formal training in networking 
and cybersecurity. For information about my work in computer science 
and information technology, see stuff/compsci.

I live with my wife, son, and daughter in Katy, Texas.

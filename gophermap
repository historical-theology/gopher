__/About\_________________________________________________________

My broad fields of study are Patristics and the theology of the 
Latin Middle Ages and Greek Byzantine periods, and my primary 
research area is the Latin Scholastic reception of the late Greek 
Fathers of the Church. For my academic statement, see 
stuff/academia.

Fueled by a Catholic desire to see humanity flourish with new 
technology rather than suffer from it, I advocate free and open 
source software (FOSS). I also have formal training in networking 
and cybersecurity. For information about my work in computer 
science and information technology, see stuff/compsci.

I live with my wife, son, and daughter in Katy, Texas.

I serve as Assistant Professor of Theology and Fellow of the 
Core in the Division of Liberal Studies at the University of 
St. Thomas in Houston, Texas.

I hold a Ph.D. in Religious Studies in the area of historical 
theology from the Theology Department at Marquette University 
(2022). I also hold a Master of Theological Studies from the 
Boston College School of Theology and Ministry (2017) and a 
Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude with majors in Theology and 
Classical Languages and a minor in Spanish from the University 
of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota (2015), both of which I 
earned precisely with the goal of receiving a doctoral degree.

My broad fields of study are Patristics and the theology of 
the Latin Middle Ages and Greek Byzantine periods. 
My research interests include the late Fathers of the Church 
(especially Sts. Maximus the Confessor, Gregory the Great, 
and John of Damascus) and their reception among the 
Latin Scholastics. 

I am an active member of the 
North American Patristics Society (NAPS), 
the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL), and 
the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH). 

Beyond my focus in historical theology and the 
history of Christianity, I engage the spectrum of the 
Catholic theological tradition from Biblical Studies to 
modern systematics.

The title of my defended dissertation is 
‚ÄúMaximus the Confessor in Aquinas‚Äôs Christology.‚Äù 
First, I tell the story of how St. Maximus the Confessor‚Äôs 
thought made it to St. Thomas Aquinas, including several 
pieces of previously unnoticed manuscript evidence. 
This reception history constitutes a majority of the project. 
Next, I explain how Thomas restored Maximianism in the 
Latin West, following his turn toward the Greek East for 
theological inspiration by walking chronologically 
through his corpus. Finally, I explore the place of Thomas‚Äôs 
Maximianism in Catholic theology today, as well as the 
relationship between my work and the cause for 
Catholic and Orthodox re-communion.

What underlies all of my historical and theological research 
is the desire to make the richness of the 
Catholic intellectual tradition known to the next generation. 
Lex orandi, lex credendi, lex vivendi is my 
perennial intellectual theme.

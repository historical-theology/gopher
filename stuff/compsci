For the duration of the year 2021, I was part of a competitive 
InfoSec networking and cybersecurity training grant cohort with
the Center for Cyber Security Awareness and Cyber Defense at 
Marquette University as the only accepted member who was not a 
graduate student in the Computer Science Department.
 
I am a proud advocate of free and open source software (FOSS), 
especially its implementation in academia. To that end, 
I have written articles for the FreeBSD Journal, 
contributed to the FreeBSD Wiki, 
and given various presentations about topics related to 
software freedom. 

Three noteworthy presentations of the kind are 
the talk that I delivered at the 2021 Free and Open Source 
Developers European Meeting (FOSDEM) on how to optimize 
multisource historical research with tiling window managers, 
my October 2021 FreeBSD Friday lecture 
“The Writing Scholar’s Guide to FreeBSD,” 
and my lecture at BSD Canada 2023 (BSDCan) that was titled 
“BSD for Researching, Writing, and Teaching the Liberal Arts.”

I maintain a custom desktop configuration, which I call 
“Theological Dotfiles,” for efficient multi-source research and 
writing in *BSD or GNU/Linux. I love computer building, and I 
used to use a home-built desktop computer for most of my work. 
After making a recent cross-country move, however, 
before which it made the most sense for me to sell my desktop 
computer hardware, I now use a docked ThinkPad T590 while at my 
desk and a freestanding ThinkPad X270 while away from my desk. 
See this blog post [/stuff/blog/openbsd-thinkpad] for a guide to 
how I have OpenBSD configured on the X270.

I have multi-year experience with Unix-like operating systems, 
including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and GNU/Linux 
(especially Debian and Manjaro), as well as some shell scripting. 
I also have strong familiarity with Zotero, LibreOffice, and 
other office software; spectrwm, i3wm, Openbox, and other 
window managers; XFCE, LXQt, and other desktop environments; 
and a range of other open source tools for desktop work.

In each of 10 summers, I lead and co-taught 
Build Your Own Computer Camp for middle school students 
at my alma mater, Marshall School in Duluth, Minnesota.

My amateur radio (vanity) callsign is N7CJS.

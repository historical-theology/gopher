CLI Bibles: Greek, Latin, & English

Since the goal of making Scripture available in an array 
of formats is widespread, it is unsurprising that Christian 
free and open source software developers have blessed us with 
various command line interface (CLI) Bibles for GNU/Linux and
other Unix-like operating systems.

The three that I use regularly are grb, vul, and kjv, 
which show the Septuagint and 
Greek New Testament (Society of Biblical Literature), 
the Vulgate, and 
the King James Version (plus the Deuterocanon/Apocrypha), 
respectively. 
All three programs have been released with the open Unlicense, 
and the biblical texts that they contain are from the
public domain.

An older version of kjv (without the Deuterocanon) was the 
original project. The GNU/Linux Youtube personality Luke Smith 
expanded kjv with the addition of the Deuterocanon. 
He also copied its format to make grb and vul. 
Thus, Smith has ensured that the Catholic canon is available 
in Greek, Latin, and English for us terminal application 
aficionados.

I have contributed (modestly) to Smith’s work by porting the 
Arch User Repository (AUR) package of the original 
kjv (kjv-git) for vul and grb as vul-git and grb-git.

Installation

1. Source

Dependencies:
bash
make

git clone https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/kjv.git
cd kjv
sudo make install

git clone https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/vul.git
cd vul
sudo make install

git clone https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/grb.git
cd grb
sudo make install

2. Arch User Repository 
(Arch & Arch-based distributions, e.g. Manjaro)

kjv-apocrypha
vul-git
grb-git

For example:
pamac install kjv-apocrypha
Usage

From the directory in which each program has been installed 
(or home, if installed in /usr/bin), type a 
standard ‘help’ command:

kjv -h
vul -h
grb -h

Basic navigation follows the norm for CLI applications:

Back (to main): q
Close (application): CTRL + c

Finally, as an example, to open the Prologue of John’s Gospel 
in Latin quickly, one could type:

vul john 1

In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, 
et Deus erat Verbum...

Deus vos benedicat,

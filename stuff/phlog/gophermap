0Hosting a Gopher Hole on a Raspberry Pi 4 via FreeBSD 14	/stuff/phlog/gopher-freebsd
and Gophernicus

Previously, I have written about my intentional minimalism in
design for this website, including my agreement with the
hyper-minimalist ideas (not the foul language) to be found in the
Suckless Project’s webpage “The Web Sucks.” Also, I have written
about how simple the installation and configuration of FreeBSD on
a Raspberry Pi 4 became with […]

0OpenBSD 7.3 on a ThinkPad X270 (plus my Theological Dotfiles)	/stuff/phlog/openbsd-thinkpad
for Scholarly Work

This tutorial (for lack of a better name) is an expanded and
polished form of my personal notes on how to install OpenBSD and
configure my Theological Dotfiles on a Lenovo ThinkPad X270. I
hope that these notes will help at least one other person
configure OpenBSD for mobile research and writing.

0How to Extend the QuirkLogic Papyr’s Useful Life with F-Droid	/stuff/phlog/quirklogic-tutorial
(no rooting or hacking required)

Introduction In my recent deep review of the QuirkLogic Papyr
E-Ink tablet, I purposefully focused on the device’s stock
settings. Since I promised the folks at QuirkLogic that I would
provide them with extensive critical feedback, I needed to keep my
feedback focused on the device exactly as they configured it. Yet,
each of us […]

0An Asst. Professor’s Deep Review of a Stock QuirkLogic Papyr	/stuff/phlog/quirklogic-review
E-Ink Tablet

I promised the folks at QuirkLogic that I would provide them with
deep, long-term analysis. After I have used my handy Papyr as a
full-time assistant professor regularly for seven months, I now
share my promised review, whether or not anyone is actually still
at QuirkLogic to read it. Is this a farewell message to a
technological startup company that has run its course, or is it
timely critical feedback that will help that company — in at least
some small way — with bringing something better to market for us
E-Ink aficionados to enjoy?

0DistroTube’s Interview “Theology Professor and Free Software	/stuff/phlog/distrotube
Advocate, Corey Stephan Ph.D.”

On October 21, 2022, I had the privilege of being interviewed by
Derek Taylor of DistroTube about my advocacy and use of free and
open source software as a professional Catholic theologian. Here,
I share a full transcript of that interview.

0My FreeBSD Friday Lecture: The Writing Scholar’s Guide to FreeBSD	/stuff/phlog/freebsd-friday

The FreeBSD Foundation is a “non-profit organization dedicated to
supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community
worldwide.” Part of the explicit mission of the Foundation is to
provide “workshops, educational material, and presentations to
recruit more users and contributors to FreeBSD.” Early in the
COVID-19 pandemic, the folks at the Foundation launched a monthly
[…]

0Raspberry Pi 4 with FreeBSD 13-RELEASE:	/stuff/phlog/pi4-freebsd
A Perfect Miniature Homelab

In the weeks leading to 13-RELEASE, the #freebsd-arm mailing list
was ablaze with a heroic collective effort to ensure that a
flawless image for the Pi 4 was available on the actual release
date. I am here to say that it was a success.

0After Traditionis custodes, is it time for the Vatican	/stuff/phlog/traditionis-custodes
to reconsider ‘extraordinary’ ministries writ large?

My observation (and, therefore, my call to correction) is that the
Vatican is inconsistent in setting its expectations for how
bishops ought to handle that which she officially defines as
“extraordinary.”

0My FOSDEM 2021 presentation on how to optimize multisource	/stuff/phlog/fosdem21
historical research with tiling window managers

The Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting (FOSDEM) is
one of the world’s largest annual gatherings for free software
advocates (like myself) and developers to share and discuss our
work. Because the meeting was virtual this year (in response to
the pandemic), I was blessed with the opportunity to participate
by pre-recording a presentation. […]

0Awesome Theology: a curated list of open source software for 	/stuff/phlog/awesome-theology
Catholic theology

One month ago, I launched the GitHub repository awesome-theology.
I intend Awesome Theology to be a new contribution to the Awesome
project. Awesome is a parent system by which “awesome lists about
all kinds of interesting topics” are made and maintained by
persons who are engaged in those topics. The Awesome Manifesto
specifies that an […]

0How to make Brightspace Desire2Learn (D2L) a bit less undesirable 	/stuff/phlog/d2l

The Learning Management System (LMS) Brightspace Desire2Learn
(D2L) was one of a number of popular software tools that I
condemned in my free software manifesto for Catholic institutions.
Ideally, nobody would use non-free, closed source institutional
spyware, including D2L. In addition to the litany of ideological
and security-related problems that come with D2L, it also […]

0With Yet Another Dotfiles Manager, dotfiles become (nearly) 	/stuff/phlog/yadm
orderly enough for this historical theologian

Historical theologians and GNU/Linux geeks both crave order where
order is hard to find. Legacy file types and minor conflicting
precedents in the tradition cause chaos to fall as acid rain on
the continents in which each group’s members work. One drop of
order brings sweet, albeit temporary, relief—whether it be a
coherent summary of […]

0Electromagnetic radiation, social distancing, & good cheer	/stuff/phlog/amateur-radio-good-cheer

As weeks of social distancing have dragged into months, good cheer
has become scarce. Spending quality time with someone outside of
one’s household has not been a (responsible) possibility for too
long. Even face-to-face interactions with extended family have
been replaced by video calls. With people trying to manage a host
of potential daily problems—unemployment […]

0Replacing Manjaro i3 with an (extremely) minimal, custom OS	/stuff/phlog/spectrwm-on-debian
for portable work: spectrwm on Debian 10

Until recently, my favorite GNU/Linux distribution was Manjaro,
which is based on Arch Linux. Manjaro is to Arch as Ubuntu is to
Debian—an overhaul of the parent distribution that is intended to
be intuitive for (nearly) all users and immediately functional on
(nearly) all desktop systems. Manjaro with i3wm—my first tiling
window manager—remains my OS […]

0On Obi-Wan, Vader, & the cultural isolation of rejecting democracy	/stuff/phlog/cultural-isolation-true-religion
for true religion

Immediately before what could have been the greatest battle of the
Star Wars franchise (if not for poor dialogue and the bizarre
setting of Mustafar)—the long-awaited first duel between Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi and his former apprentice who had just turned to
the Dark Side and pledged his subservience to Darth Sidious—there
is a perplexing exchange: […]

0coreystephan.com’s new minimal design (& my thanks to the Suckless	/stuff/phlog/minimal-web-design
folks for inspiration)

Although I cannot endorse the hostile tone of the folks who
participate in the Suckless project (“Software that Sucks Less”
inasmuch as it is both free and open source and as minimal as
possible while functioning as intended), I am grateful for their
work. Like many GNU/Linux aficionados, I use the “Stuff that
rocks” list […]

0For remote instruction, faculty and administrators at Catholic 	/stuff/phlog/remote-instruction-free-software
institutions should turn to free & open source software

Faculty and administrators at Catholic institutions have a
responsibility—perhaps, I dare suggest, a moral imperative—to
employ free and open source software. That responsibility becomes
particularly clear during a time when we are all involved in
remote instruction as a temporary means of survival. At this
moment, we have a unique opportunity to reevaluate our software
choices. Let us not allow that opportunity to be wasted. Moving
forward, we ought to use only free and open source software.

0CLI Bibles: Greek, Latin, & English	/stuff/phlog/cli-bibles

Since the goal of making Scripture available in an array of
formats is widespread, it is unsurprising that Christian free and
open source software developers have blessed us with various
command line interface (CLI) Bibles for GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems. The three that I use regularly are
grb, vul, and kjv, which show […]
